Last night I just know about Cursor and download it from the internet, and two hours befor I just download Obsidian although I've know it many years ago.
I really don't know when will I meet a new tool, which may improve my workflow or slow down it.
But how can I apply those new tools into practice really matters a lot, I mean, how long we need to apply it. Now, my answer is as soon as possible.
